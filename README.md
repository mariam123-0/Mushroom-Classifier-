# Mushroom-Classifier
Mushroom Classifier is an AI-powered application built with Streamlit that predicts whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous. The user answers a series of questions about the mushroomâ€™s features (such as cap shape, color, odor, and gill type), and the trained model analyzes the inputs to give a clear result. This makes it an interactive and easy-to-use tool for testing AI classification in a real-world scenario.
